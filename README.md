# C482 Inventory Project

The goal of this project was to write an inventory application that could track parts and products. The products can also have parts associated with them. 

The application allows users to search, add, delete, and modify parts and products. 

It does not store parts and products, so these are lost when the application is restarted. I hard-coded sample parts for testing purposes. 

I wrote the application in Java and created the UI with Scene Builder.
